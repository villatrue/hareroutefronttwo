##Hare Route

-Logistics solution for route planning given route with user provided information. 

-Used Rails as the backend to store user’s saved data and created associations in the database schema using active record, with React as the frontend.

-Used Mapquest api to get the latitude and longitude of every address the user provided and then used that data to fetch an optimized route using RouteXL’s api then saved that Data to the backend. 

-Once the route is saved to the backend the route is then displayed on a map using Google Maps. 

-React Router was used to navigate throughout the app. 

-Mainly used Material UI and React Hooks to style the components.
